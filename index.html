            <h1>Pamela's Diner</h1><br/>
            <p>
                Pamela's Diner is a prominent chain of diners in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.<br/><br/>
                Its specialties are crÃªpe-style pancakes, omelets and Lyonnaise potatoes.<br/><br/> 
                It is "treasured" and is considered to be in the "pantheon of pancake purveyors".<br/><br/>
                In 2013, Pamela's Diner was featured by the Wall Street Journal in a "What to Do in Pittsburgh" feature story.<br/><br/> 
                Pamela's Diner is owned by Gail Klingensmith and Pam Cohen.[1] Both educated as teachers, the business partners handle different tasks, Klingensmith with the more business end and Cohen as "the culinary artist".<br/><br/>
                The first Pamela's Diner location, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, opened in 1979.<br/><br/>
                Subsequent locations have opened in Shadyside, the Strip District, Millvale, Oakland and Mt. Lebanon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

            <h1>Recent information</h1><br/>
            <p>
                During the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama visited Pamela's Diner for a campaign visit. <br/><br/> 
                Once elected, President Obama invited Klingensmith and Cohen to the White House for a Memorial Day breakfast with the Obama family and 80 veterans. <br/><br/> 
                Later that year, during the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit, President Obama expressed dismay that he was unable to return to Pamela's Diner during that trip, but First Lady Michelle Obama did visit. <br/><br/> 
                Incidentally, the Oakland storefront received damage during the protests that accompanied the G-20 summit. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> 
                Pamela's Diner announced in December 2021 that their original Squirrel Hill location will be closing largely due to COVID-19. <br/><br/> 
                With the loss of several long-time employees, the location decided to shut its doors. As the first Pamela's Diner location, it has been around 42 years. <br/><br/>
                The other diner locations will stay open, however. The owners hinted that they are open to another, smaller Squirrel Hill location in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
